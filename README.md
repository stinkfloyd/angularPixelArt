# AngularPixelArt

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## ABOUT 
I made this app in a little over four hours to practice Angular techniques such as dynamically creating DOM elements and passing events and data between components.
